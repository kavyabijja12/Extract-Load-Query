# Extract, Load and Query Data
## Introduction
Extracting data from various sources, followed by loading it into a database and then querying this data. The objective is to streamline data processes and support informed decision-making through efficient analysis and retrieval.

## Objectives
- Extract data from a web page
- Load into a sqlite database 
- Query from the database

## Notes
- Web scraping is used for extraction of relevant data from web pages. If you require some data from a web page in a public domain, web scraping makes the process of data extraction quite convenient. 
- Using databases is an important and useful method of sharing information. To preserve repeated storage of the same files containing the required data, it is a good practice to save the said data on a database on a server and access the required subset of information using database management systems.
